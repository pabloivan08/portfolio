Typography is one of the most underestimated elements in web design. While users may not consciously notice good typography, they immediately feel when something is wrong. As web designers, typography is not decoration — it is structure, usability, and communication.

Good typography helps users scan content, understand hierarchy, and trust the product. Poor typography creates friction, confusion, and fatigue.

## 1. Typography Is About Function First

Before thinking about style, typography must solve a problem: **readability**.

Ask yourself:
- Can users easily scan the page?
- Is the content readable on different screen sizes?
- Does the typography support the message?

A beautiful font that is hard to read is a bad design decision.

---

## 2. Visual Hierarchy Guides the User

Hierarchy tells users **what to read first, second, and last**.

You create hierarchy through:
- Font size  
- Font weight  
- Spacing  
- Color contrast  

A clear hierarchy allows users to understand a page in seconds, which is critical for conversion and usability.

---

## 3. Limit Your Font Choices

More fonts do not mean better design.

A solid rule:
- One font for headings  
- One font for body text  

(or even a single well-chosen family)

Consistency builds trust and keeps interfaces clean, scalable, and easy to maintain — especially in CMS-based projects.

---

## 4. Line Height and Spacing Matter More Than You Think

Good typography breathes.

Recommended guidelines:
- Body text line-height: **1.5 – 1.7**  
- Headings: tighter, but never cramped  
- Generous spacing between sections  

White space is not empty space — it is a design tool.

---

## 5. Responsive Typography Is Not Optional

Typography must adapt across devices.

Best practices:
- Use relative units (`rem`, `em`)  
- Adjust heading sizes for mobile  
- Avoid text blocks that are too wide on desktop  

A responsive layout with poor typography is still a poor experience.

---

## 6. Typography Supports Brand Identity

Typography communicates personality:
- Serif fonts often feel editorial or elegant  
- Sans-serif fonts feel modern and digital  
- Rounded fonts feel friendly  
- Condensed fonts feel bold and expressive  

Typography should match the brand’s tone while remaining functional.

---

## 7. Design for Real Content, Not Lorem Ipsum

Typography decisions should be made using **real content** whenever possible.

Real headlines, real paragraphs, real button labels reveal issues that placeholder text hides — especially in multilingual or CMS-driven websites.

---

## Conclusion

Great typography is invisible when done right, but powerful in its impact.

As web designers, mastering typography means creating interfaces that are:
- Clear  
- Accessible  
- Scalable  
- User-centered  

Typography is not just about choosing fonts — it’s about designing how information is experienced.
