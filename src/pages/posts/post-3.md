A successful website is the result of a clear process, strong collaboration, and continuous communication.  
Without structure, even good design and clean code can fail.

This workflow reflects how I approach web projects, from the first conversation with the client to a smooth and confident launch.

---

## 1. Discovery and Client Alignment

Every project starts with understanding the problem.

At this stage, I focus on:
- Business goals
- Target users
- Content requirements
- Technical constraints

Clear alignment early prevents misunderstandings and sets realistic expectations for all teams involved.

---

## 2. User Research and Structure

Before designing interfaces, I define structure.

This includes:
- Content hierarchy
- User flows
- Key actions and conversions

The goal is to make information easy to find and actions easy to complete.

---

## 3. UI/UX Design

With a solid structure in place, I move into visual design.

My focus here is:
- Clear hierarchy
- Consistent typography
- Reusable layout patterns
- Responsive behavior

Design decisions are always documented and shared with stakeholders to encourage feedback early in the process.

---

## 4. Development and Integration

Once designs are validated, I start development.

I build using:
- Semantic HTML
- Scalable CSS (often with Sass)
- JavaScript for meaningful interactions

In CMS-based projects, I ensure that designs translate into flexible, editable components that clients can manage without breaking the layout.

---

## 5. Collaboration With Cross-Functional Teams

Web projects are rarely solo efforts.

I work closely with:
- Designers
- Developers
- Consultants
- Sales teams

Regular communication helps align design decisions with technical feasibility and business requirements.

---

## 6. Testing and Quality Assurance

Before launch, I test thoroughly:
- Responsive behavior
- Content flexibility
- Performance
- Accessibility basics

This step ensures the product is stable, usable, and ready for real users.

---

## 7. Launch and Client Training

Launch is not the end, it’s a transition.

I focus on:
- Smooth deployment
- Clear handoff
- Client training

Empowering clients to manage their website confidently is essential for long-term success.

---

## 8. Post-Launch Feedback and Iteration

After launch, I gather feedback from:
- Users
- Clients
- Internal teams

This feedback helps refine the product and share insights with R&D teams to improve future projects and existing themes.

---

## Conclusion

A practical workflow balances creativity, structure, and collaboration.

By maintaining clear communication and involving all stakeholders, websites become not only visually strong, but sustainable, scalable, and successful long after launch.

Great products are built through process, not shortcuts.
